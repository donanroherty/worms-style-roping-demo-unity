BETA FEATURES
=============
Skyshop 1.05 ships with several new features that are not quite production ready but fun to play with and a useful preview of what's coming down the line. It is also a way for us to test experimental features out in the wild so if you experience problems with anything beta, please let us know at support@marmoset.co.

**Developers working on existing, large-scale projects would be wise to steer clear of beta features as they may change in the next few releases.

BOX PROJECTED CUBEMAPS
The beta shader category has a sub-category named "Box Projection" containing the four basic diffuse, specular, and bump shaders. These shaders, when used with skies that have proper bounds, will perform a special kind of cubemap lookup. Instead of sampling the cubemap as if it were infinitely distant, box-projected lookups take into account some arbitrary bounding box in world-space assigned to the cubemap, and sample it as projected onto the walls of this box. This means that the lookup is dependent on the position, orientation, and bounds of the box, as well as the position of the surface being rendered.

Currently box projection is limited only to the shaders that have the feature enabled, which live in the Marmoset/Beta/Box Projection category. In the future, all shaders will use this feature, though it will remain optional as there is some performance overhead.

To use box projection:
- Assign one of these shaders to your object
- Enable the checkbox "Has Dimensions" on the active sky
- Define the bounds of the sky using its transform scale attributes
- Your object must be within the sky bounds to render properly


SPHERICAL HARMONICS
All skies now contain spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to represent their diffuse image-based light term. These coefficients are a set of 27 magic numbers that represent the entire diffuse cubemap. These coefficients are computed in the Sky Inspector every time a sky, diffuse, or specular cubemap slot is changed. The computation may cause a slight hitch in performance but nothing like a full compute. Running "Edit/Skyshop/Refresh Scene Skies" will also recompute SH coefficients.

Currently SH is beta. While it is computed for every sky, it is only used by the skin shader and the Marmoset/Beta/Spherical Harmonics/ category of shaders. In the future, all shaders will use SH and the diffuse cubemap will be phased out, because of the many performance benefits. 

The Spherical Harmonics/ category also includes some vertex lit shaders as examples of the fastest IBL shaders yet. Vertex lit shaders can do the diffuse SH lookup per vertex instead of per fragment, leaving only the specular IBL lookup in the fragment program.


SKIN SHADER
Spherical harmonics allows for fancier lighting and IBL scattering simulations so Skyshop 1.05 includes the beginnings of a skin shader in the Marmoset/Beta category.

Sub-Surface Scattering - Simulation of how light enters the dermal and subdermal layers of skin, bounces around a bit, and bounces back out.

Translucency - Simulation of how light passes through thin parts of the model directly; for example, ear lobes and lips.

Peach Fuzz - Simulation of tiny fibers on a surface reflecting and refracting light at grazing viewing angles. Also known as "Diffuse Fresnel".

Anisotropic Highlights - Typically a hair-shader feature, a simulation of specular light reflecting off a mass of aligned strands, forming a long, linear highlight perpendicular to these strands.

Subdermis & Subdermis Color
- Define the amount of sub-surface scattering that happens in the subdermal layers of skin
- 0 means standard diffuse lighting, 255 is maximum scattering
- Can be defined per color component. Human skin scatters more red light than blue for instance.

Subdermis(RGB) Skin Mask(A)
- RGB of this texture defines Subdermis strength/color.
- A of this texture masks off ALL skin shader effects.
- Skin mask is useful for rendering clothing, jewelry, etc. within the same texture sheet.

Translucency & Sky Translucency
- Translucency defines the color and amount of light that can pass through to the back-side of the model.
- Sky Translucency is a multiplier on the amount of image-based light transmits to the back-side (it's often useful to tone this down).

Translucency Map
- RGB of this texture defines Translucency strength & color.

Fuzz & Fuzz Color
- Strength and color of diffuse fresnel at grazing angles of the model.

Fuzz Scatter 
- Defines the falloff of diffuse fresnel at grazing angles

Fuzz Occlusion
- Amount of shadowing and self-occlusion used to mask fuzz on the dark side of a model and within shadows

Anisotropy & Anisotropy Direction
- Amount of "stretching" of the specular highlight
- Anisotropy Direction defines tangent-space (uv-space) direction of highlight stretching.
- Only affects direct lighting
- Useful for hair
