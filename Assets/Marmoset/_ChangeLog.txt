Skyshop 1.06 Change Log
=====================
Features
 - Sky script now has an "Auto-Apply" toggle.
    - When enabled, the sky will be bound on level load and whenever selected in the editor (as before)
    - When disabled, the sky can only be bound through scripting using the Apply function
    - Disabling can be useful when working with multiple skies or sky probes    
    
 - "Apply to Viewport" button to bind non-auto-apply skies to the viewport in edit mode
 
 - Sky script now handles OnTriggerEnter and OnTriggerExit events
   - The sky object needs a physics collider with the "Is Trigger" option enabled for these event to fire
   - OnTriggerEnter applies the sky to any object with a collider and renderer
   - OnTriggerExit applies the globally-bound activeSky to any renderers leaving the trigger

 - Added "Skin Fast IBL" shader to Beta/ shaders
   - Intended for mobile by keeping texture samples and complexity down to a useful minimum
   - Shader has NoForwardAdd flag (one directional light only)
   - Combined texture for Diffuse (RGB) Gloss (A)
   - Uniform specular color/intensity, no specular map
   - Uniform subdermis color, no subdermis map or skin mask
   - Uniform translucency color, No translucency map
   - No IBL translucency (direct lights only)
   - No IBL specular (direct lights only)
   - No anisotropic highlights
   - No alpha testing
   
 - Reload buttons to manually refresh the textures referenced by cubemap slots
 - New-All, Find-All, and Clear-All buttons 
 - "Panorama Name" field for easy naming of cubemaps created with "New" and "New All"
 - Simple Terrain shaders work on mobile platforms

Edit/Skyshop
 - Unity no longer freezes when entering play mode with an Input Panorama present (serialization/memory bug)
 - Adjusting intensity and exposure sliders no longer causes SH recompute (no more lagging!)
 - Skyshop convolutions are no longer brighter than the source image (better normalization term)
 - Input Panorama textures are set to "Bypass sRGB" before being used as input (fixes LDR horiz. cross gamma issue)
 - Cubemap probes can be captured at 2048x2048 now
 
Shaders
 - Skin shader now also scatters Unity light probes
 - Skin and spherical harmonics brightness now matches other IBL cubes
 - Fixed translucency with omni and spotlights
 - Added 90 more degrees of range to anisotropic direction (now 0-180 degrees)
 - Vertex Color and Vertex Occlusion shaders work with Unity's image and post effects (can't be custom render-type)
 - Mobile Translucency and Simple Glass shaders work on Android again (was missing #MARMO_ALPHA)
 - Shaders now keep a float _SkyID to make sure skies can only unbind themselves from specific renderers
 - Box projection no longer affects diffuse lookups (it is expensive and looks bad with a diffuse distribution).
 
Known Issues
 - Box projection works only in Unity 4.3+ (#pragma multi-compile requirements).
 - Skyshop cubemap previews have to be refreshed manually when returning from play mode (Reload All button).
   This is an alternative to the slow, memory-intensive serialization method that caused Unity to freeze in 1.05
 - Vertex Occlusion and Vertex Color are ignored when capturing HDR cubemaps, a limitation of Unity's RenderType
   and replacement shader system.
 - Marmoset's Advanced Terrain shaders do not work on mobile platforms yet (investigation continues).

 - Skin Shader (Beta)
 - Anisotropic Highlights (Beta, skin shader only)
 - HDR Render to Cubemap

Script
 - Skyshop no longer clears inputs and settings when entering play mode
 - Added Apply(Renderer target) function to Sky script for per-object Sky binding
 - Added diffuse spherical harmonic computation to happen automatically in the SkyInspector
 - Added undo helpers into Util to conform to both Unity 4.2 and Unity 4.3 undo API
 - Cleaned up Undo and made it more specific in a few cases
 - Fixed non-mipmapped specular preview bug in SkyInspector
 - Fixed mset_BeastConfig unreferenced leak
 - Added UniformOcclusion shader parameter that can be set per object
 - Added Sky.Apply to drawGizmosSelected for sky changes without an open inspector tab
 - Cleaned up and refactored Sky.cs
 - Added proper serialization support to a whole list of classes
 
Edit/Skyshop
 - "Create Prefabs from Selected" will create prefabs from all selected skies (required for old skies).

Shaders
 - Added "Beta" shader category for new shaders that are not quite production-ready
 - Added Box Projection Cube-Mapping (Beta)
 - Added diffuse spherical harmonics (Beta)
 - Added SH-based skin shader (Beta)
 - Added anisotropic direct light specular (Beta, skin shader only)
 - Removed manual sRGB sampling code from grass & detail shaders (Unity 4.3 fixed a bug)
 - Fixed invalid fallback paths in mobile & terrain shaders
 - Made non-blended shaders output alpha of 1.0
 - Disabled lightmapping in mobile bumped-spec shaders that use vertex colors/occlusion (too many interpolators)

New shader feature #defines
 - #define MARMO_BOX_PROJECTION 1
 - #define MARMO_SPHERICAL_HARMONICS 1
 - #define MARMO_ALPHA

Alpha
 - Shaders will write 1.0 into the output alpha unless this flag is defined

Box Projection
 - Shaders with box projection enabled treat the Sky as being a box with finite dimensions
 - Sky object's transform scale defines the bounds of the projection box
 - Does not yet work with vertex-lit shaders
 - Enabled with #define MARMO_BOX_PROJECTION 1 (Note: the 1 is new and important)
 - Can also be toggled as a multi-compile keyword
 - This feature is considered beta and only enabled in the beta category of shaders

Spherical Harmonics
 - All skies now compute spherical harmonics coefficients to be used in place of the diffuse IBL cubemap
 - SH is computed from the specular, skybox, or diffuse cube depending on which is present
 - SH is computed automatically in the Sky Inspector, no recomputation necessary for older content.
 - SH will be used in place of the diffuse IBL cubemap in shaders that enable the feature
 - Enabled with #define MARMO_SPHERICAL_HARMONICS 1
 - This feature is considered beta and only enabled in the beta category of shaders

Known Issues
 - Unity 4.2 grass & detail shaders are now rendered incorrectly, they still need manual sRGB sampling which was fixed in Unity 4.3.0.
 - Old Sky objects cannot be turned into prefabs (they lose script references), use Edit->Skyshop->Create Prefabs from Selected
 - RGBM probe does not capture transparent objects
 - RGBM probe does not capture tree or grass billboards properly

 - Removed blending from Transparent/Cutout (conforms to Unity & fixes shadows)
 - Added "approxview" to all mobile shaders & fallbacks
 - Fixed Mobile/Fast shader typos 
Menus
 - Changed "Refresh Skies" shortcut to ctrl+shift+R (ctrl+R is taken)
