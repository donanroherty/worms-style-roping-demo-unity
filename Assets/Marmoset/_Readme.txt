REQUIREMENTS
Marmoset Skyshop requires Unity Free or Pro, version 4.2 or newer (for a Unity 3.5 legacy build, email support@marmoset.co).
Marmoset IBL Shaders require Shader Model 3.0 or equivalent.
Mobile shaders have been tested on iOS 6, and Android 4.1.1.

Note: Skyshop includes a custom build of Lightmapping Extended which conflicts with the Asset Store version. Remove any old build of LME from your project before importing.


INSTALLATION 
Import the Skyshop package file into your project. It will contain two top-level folders:
Gizmos/
Marmoset/

Feel free to move the Marmoset/ folders anywhere within your project, but the Gizmos/ folders must remain in the root Assets/ folder of your project (or be merged with the contents of an existing Gizmos/ folder).

To launch Skyshop, click on the Window menu at the top of your screen and find "Skyhsop" from the list.

Taking a closer look inside the Marmoset folder, you will find several sub-categories:
Shaders/ - all Marmoset IBL shaders bundled with Skyshop reside here. Do not re-arrange the contents of the Shaders/ folder.
Skyshop/ - contains all editor and runtime scripts, as well as all the GUI textures needed to run Skyshop.
Docs/ - contains detailed documentation on various Skyshop topics, all as .txt files so you can read them in the Unity Inspector.

If you are more of a learn-by-example type, the Marmoset folder also contains an Examples.zip file, full of useful example scenes, example skies, and art content for you to get started with. The Examples package also includes some handy scripts demonstrating in-game interaction with Skyshop content and skies. Feel free to delete this zip file and all its contents, they are not necessary for Skyshop to function.

You are ready to enjoy Marmoset Skyshop! If you experience problems, feel free to contact us directly at support@marmoset.co.

If you are looking for some panoramic sky content to try out, there are plenty of online resources to tap. Here are some of our staff picks:

Note that not all of the skies you will find online are licensed for commercial use so be mindful of downloading skies you may eventually wish to ship with a commercial game. Quality light-probes are not easy to make, and our hats are off to the folks who are good at it. --The Marmoset Team
